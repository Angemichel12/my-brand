        Is it harder for machines to mimic the way humans move or the way humans
        think? If you had asked me this question a decade ago, my answer would
        have been “think.” So much of how the brain works is still a mystery.
        And yet, in just the last year, advancements in artificial intelligence
        have resulted in computer programs that can create, calculate, process,
        understand, decide, recognize patterns, and continue learning in ways
        that resemble our own. Building machines that operate like our
        bodies—that walk, jump, touch, hold, squeeze, grip, climb, slice, and
        reach like we do (or better)—would seem to be an easier feat in
        comparison. Surprisingly, it hasn’t been. Many robots still struggle to
        perform basic human tasks that require the dexterity, mobility, and
        cognition most of us take for granted. But if we get the technology
        right, the uses for robots will be almost limitless: Robots can help
        during natural disasters when first responders would otherwise have to
        put their lives on the line—or during public health crises like the
        COVID pandemic, when in-person interactions might spread disease. On
        farms, they can be used instead of toxic chemical herbicides to manually
        pull weeds. They can work long days lugging hundred- or thousand-pound
        loads around factory floors. A good enough robotic arm will also be
        invaluable as a prosthesis. I understand concerns about robots taking
        people’s jobs, an unfortunate consequence of almost every new
        innovation—including the internet, which (for example) turned everyone
        into a travel agent and eliminated much of the vacation-planning
        industry. If robots have a similar impact on employment, governments and
        the private sector will have to help people navigate the transition. But
        given present labor shortages in our economy and the dangerous or
        unrewarding nature of certain professions, I believe it’s less likely
        that robots replace us in jobs we love and more likely that they’ll do
        work people don’t want to be doing. In the process, they can make us
        safer, healthier, more productive, and even less lonely.
